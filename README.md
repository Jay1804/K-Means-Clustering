# K-Means-Clustering

Customer Segmentation in Python
Segmentation using K-Means Clustering Algorithm

Suppose that we have a company that deals in various products and you want to understand how well is the performance of the sales of these products.

We have the data that can we analyze, but what kind of analysis that we can do?

Well, we can segment customers based on their buying behaviour on the market.

Keep in mind that the data is really huge, and we can not analyze it by just looking at an overiew of it. We have to use machine learning algorithms to do the job easier for us.

Here we will discuss how to cluster customers on segments based on their behaviour using the K-Means clustering in Python.

Steps of Analysis
We will perform this analysis in the following steps:

Gather the data
Pre-process the data
Explore the data
Cluster the data
Interpret the result
